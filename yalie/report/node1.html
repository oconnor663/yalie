Introduction</A>
</H1>
One of the historical attractions of the Lisp family of programming
languages has been their flexibility. Lisp was one of the first
languages to include dynamic typing, and Lisp macros allow the
programmer to create new binding forms and control structures. This
flexibility is one of the reasons for Lisp's popularity in the AI
community. Programmers can implement domain-specific mini-languages
without losing the infrastructure of a full language implementation.

<P>
Another strength of Lisp is its elegance. The S-expression syntax
allows Lisp to treat lists as code. Thus Lisp macros, by constructing
and returning lists of symbols, actually return code. This is one of
the more confusing aspects of Lisp for newcomers, to be sure, but it
also simplifies the language in an important sense. Where most
languages have code and data, Lisp has only data. In the long run,
fewer ``moving parts'' means fewer distinct concepts that a programmer
needs to keep in mind to understand his language.

<P>
More recent developments, however, have seen Lisp fall behind. In
particular, the Smalltalk language demonstrated that it is possible to
treat everything in a language as an ``object.'' The popular Python
and Ruby languages have adopted many concepts from Smalltalk with
great success. Several object-oriented variants of Lisp have been
developed, including the Common Lisp Object System, but these have not
achieved nearly the same popularity. We wish to suggest that one of
the failings of various Lisp object systems is that they are built for
the wrong reasons.

<P>
Through object-orientation, Smalltalk was able to achieve greater
flexibility and greater simplicity. These goals are essentially
orthogonal to the goal of facilitating an object-oriented programming
style. Lisp object systems have attempted the latter, and as a result
they have generally made their languages more complicated and less
consistent. We believe that object-orientation can greatly enhance
Lisp's core strengths, but only if these concepts are introduced
consistently throughout the entire language.

<P>
This is the intention of Yet Another Lisp Interpreting Experiment (or,
``Yalie''). Our goal is to demonstrate a Lisp variant in which
everything is an object and all function calls are based on message
passing. In doing this, we hope to make the language less complicated,
rather than more so. An interactive interpreter for Yalie, written in
Python, accompanies this paper. What follows is a partial formal
description of the language implemented in that interpreter.  For a
practical description, please see the accompanying README file. This
paper assumes basic familiarity with a modern Lisp dialect such as
Scheme or Common Lisp.
