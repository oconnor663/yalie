Conclusions</A>
</H1>
Several different interpreters were created at different stages in
this project, but the ``call'' and ``eval'' semantics were only
included in the final version. The ease of coding these semantics
relative to the more standard approach (using a central eval loop) was
striking, both in reduced programming time and in reduced debugging
time. These semantics are also far easier to modify than any previous.

<P>
The language is still very small, so some of the benefits of the
object-oriented approach are not yet apparent. One tangible benefit is
that, despite having gutted the entire language to allow the
ubiquitous use of objects, the only difference visible in the global
namespace is the existence of the <TT>msg</TT> function. All other
object-oriented functionality is confined within the method spaces. If
we were to further extend the language--with strings and file handles
for example--we would see the same benefits repeated, with new
functionality mostly confined to method spaces. Not only does this
approach keep the global namespace free of clutter, it also provides
helpful documentation in the form of method lists.

<P>
The example of adding a factorial method to the entire set of integers
(see README) demonstrates the flexibility of the object-oriented
approach, and though the language is still small, the improved
consistency of the semantics has already made itself felt during the
implementation process. We look forward to finding new ways of
leveraging the object abstraction, both by itself and in conjunction
with Lisp's macro system.
