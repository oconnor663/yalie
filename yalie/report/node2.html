<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Concepts</A>
</H1>
Broadly speaking, there are two major categories of object-oriented
languages.[<A
 HREF="node6.html#Abadi">1</A>] The most familiar and popular are the
``class-based'' languages, including C++, Java, and Smalltalk. The
other category is ``object-based'' or ``prototype-based'' languages,
like JavaScript and Lua. Class-based languages distinguish classes
from the objects that belong to them, and inheritance is accomplished
within the class hierarchy. Object-based languages omit this
distinction, and instead allow objects to inherit from one another and
produce their own clone or child objects. In practice, object-based
languages often approximate classes by using certain objects solely
for inheritance, and for that reason--and because of the wider
popularity of class-based languages--some have argued that making
classes an explicit part of the language is more
convenient.[<A
 HREF="node6.html#Bruce">2</A>] Our primary purpose here, though, is
simplicity and consistency, so ours will be an object-based semantics.

<P>
We will also be taking a less conventional approach to specifying the
semantics of our language. With the goal of unifying code and data, we
will first describe the translation from syntax to literal objects and
then separately define the methods available to those objects. This is
also intended to highlight the fact that the vast majority of the
functionality of Yalie is contained in predefined methods for our
objects, rather than in the syntax of our language.

<P>
The semantics of our language will be built from three components:
objects, the scope, and the store. Objects will be treated as simple
tuples, of the form <!-- MATH
 $(p,\phi_1,\phi_2,d)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ (p,\phi_1,\phi_2,d)$"></SPAN>, containing a reference to a
parent object, a scope of methods, a scope of member objects, and a
data field for builtin data like integers. Scopes--denoted by
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img2.png"
 ALT="$ \phi$"></SPAN>--are maps from names to natural numbers or (in the case of
method scopes) functions, and the store--denoted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img3.png"
 ALT="$ \sigma$"></SPAN>--is a
map from natural numbers to objects. In this way, the store is
intended to simulate a persistent memory of mutable objects, and for
our purposes we can understand the store as unique (in contrast to
scopes, of which there will be many). The extension of a scope or
store is represented by the expression ``<!-- MATH
 $[\phi|key\rightarrow
val]$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="98" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img4.png"
 ALT="$ [\phi\vert key\rightarrow
val]$"></SPAN>''. The smallest currently unassigned integer in a store is
denoted by ``<!-- MATH
 $\operatorname{next}(\sigma)$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="56" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img5.png"
 ALT="$ \operatorname{next}(\sigma)$"></SPAN>''. The empty scope and the
empty store are denoted by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img6.png"
 ALT="$ \phi_0$"></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img7.png"
 ALT="$ \sigma_0$"></SPAN>, respectively.

<P>
We have put Yalie together so that externally it resembles a
traditional Lisp, but the underlying semantics are very different. In
particular, functions and special forms are just objects with a
predefined ``call'' method. The mechanism of a function call is that
the ``eval'' method of a list implicitly evaluates its first element
and passes the rest of the list as arguments to the first element's
call method. The ``msg'' special form is then provided with a call
method that allows the user to pass arbitrary messages.
